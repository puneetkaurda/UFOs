# UFOs
## Overview of the analysis:
 The ananlysis is to  create an interactive webpage containing UFO sightings that can be filtered by date, city, state, country, and shape with Javascript , HTML and d3.

## Results:
 The webpage displays UFO sightings that have been reported around the world.There are five filters you can use for your search; and you can use any combination of these filters to narrow down the results. For the state and country filters, you must use the two letter abbreviation associated with them. For example, New Mexico is abbreviated as 'nm'. The  search for UFO sighting(s) by filtering on date, city, state, country, and shape. The table displays results according to user input (changes in the filters). For example, if I were to filter by a date as 1/10/2010, my table shows 11 results. If I wanted to filter  by a state of "co" (Colorado), the table would then show 4 results.  By clicking on "UFO sightings" at the top left corner will reset the table by clearing out all my filters.

## Summary: 
 The drawbacks of this new design is with the date filter. There should be a range of days in the search criteria.And there should be drop-down menu in each filter to allow the user to select from the given choices.
 The recommendations  would be to see the sigtings within certain timeframe  and adding another filter to add "duraion of sightings" as we already have the data in the table which would be interesting to see  the sigthings that were < 10 minutes or between 15-20 minutes.
